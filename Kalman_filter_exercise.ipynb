    "## Optional advanced exercise: Kalman filter for track fitting of LHCb data\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide here an additional exercise that you are welcome to try in case you finish the other ones very quickly or if you already had basic knowledge of CUDA programming and wanted to skip the first very basic exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of fitting tracks in the VELO tracking detector of the LHCb experiment with a Kalman filter - so it is a more practical HEP example. There is no magnetic field in the VELO detector, so particle trajectories are straight lines. The VELO is a silicon pixel detector providing 3D measurement points in the global coordinate system of LHCb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we use CMake for compilation and build libraries from CUDA code. So if you are interested in some of the implementation specifics, feel free to look at the source code for inspiration. A Kalman filter is one method for track fitting, i.e. it happens after the pattern recognition step. This means that the hits originating from the same particle have already been identified and we now want to describe the trajectory such that we can extrapolate for example to other parts of the detector. The Kalman filter subsequently iterates over all hits of a track. For every hit, it estimates the state (i.e. direction and uncertainty) of the track at that point. With the addition of every hit the estimate becomes more precise until the the best linear estimator is achieved at the last hit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we provide you with collection of hits making up the tracks. They are stored in two containers: `hits` contains all space points present on all tracks. `tracks` contains indices to the hits of particular tracks. We also provide the code that runs the Kalman filter on both the CPU and the GPU. The GPU code is however not yet parallelized and no optimizations have been performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to parallelize the GPU function and then to optimize step by step the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the files referenced in every part of the exercise in an editor tab by clicking on them in your clone of the exercise repository!\n",
